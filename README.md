Sometimes when I'm bored I try to solve some problems over at [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). It keeps my left cerebral hemisphere in shape. At least that's what I tell myself.

My weapon of choice for these problems is C. All committed implementations have been verified on Project Euler as producing the correct result. I've chosed to git ignore the binaries but feel free to compile and try them out yourself.
